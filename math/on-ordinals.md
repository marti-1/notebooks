* [Constructive Ordinal Notation Systems](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2689658) -- proof that there exists a constructive ordinal notation system that could in theory make all the constructive ordinals. it also shows that the notation of this system is not recursive -- there is no algorithm that can tell if some number is a notation of a limit ordinal.
