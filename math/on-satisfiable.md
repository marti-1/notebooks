# Satisfiable

A [formula](https://github.com/marti-1/notebooks/blob/master/math/on-formulas.md) $A$ is _satisfiable_ if there is at least one [truth assignment](https://github.com/marti-1/notebooks/blob/master/math/on-truth-assignment.md) $\phi$ such that $\phi(A) = T$; in this case, we also say that the truth assignment $\phi$ _satisfies_ the formula $A$. If there is no truth assignment that satisfies $A$, we say that $A$ is _unsatisfiable_.

A set of formulas $\Gamma$ is _satisfiable_ if there is at least one truth assignment $\phi$ that satisfies every formula in $\Gamma$ aka. $\phi$ is a _model_ of $\Gamma$. If there is not truth assignment that satisfies $\Gamma$, we say that $\Gamma$ is _unsatisfiable_.
