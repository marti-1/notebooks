# Tautology

A formula $A$ of propositional logic is a _tautology_ if $\phi(A) = T$ for every truth assignment $\phi$. For example $A = p~\lor~!p$:

| Assignment | p | ¬p | p ∨ ¬p |
|------------|---|----|--------|
| $$\phi_1$$ | T | F  | T      |
| $$\phi_2$$ | F | T  | T      |

A tautology is true by virtue of its connectives and is independent of the interpretation of its propositional variables. For example $p\lor q$ is not a tautology, whilst $p \lor !p$ is. Tautology is a higher order truth. It expresses a **logical argument from** that is true in all **logical** universes.
