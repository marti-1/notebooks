You can think of theory as a set of axioms ($\Gamma \vdash \varphi$), or as any set $\Gamma$ of statements which is consistent and closed under deduction ($\varphi \in \Gamma$).

Often, it is easier to think in terms of axioms -- we often have a hard time classifying membership in $\Gamma$. [1](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4907203/confusion-about-what-first-order-theory-is)

$$\Gamma \vdash \varphi \Leftrightarrow \varphi \in \Gamma$$
