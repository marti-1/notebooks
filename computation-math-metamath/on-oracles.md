**Why can't we have a "god" oracle that would tell if any Turing machine with an oracle halt?**

If we had one (e.g. G(x,y)), then the Turing's argument would apply again:

Assume G(x,y) exists. Then we can again apply diagonalization and get a machine which is undecidable by G(x,y). This is a contradiction. So, we can't have such an oracle.
