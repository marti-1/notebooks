[The Arithmetic Hierarchy and Computability](https://risingentropy.com/the-arithmetic-hierarchy-and-computability/comment-page-1/#comment-2100)

The article presents an argument why the arithmetical hierarchy is infinite:

> there are an uncountable infinity of sets of naturals, and only countably many sets of naturals in each level of the hierarchy. (This is because each level of the hierarchy is equivalent to the sets that are computable/recursively enumerable/co-RE using a TM with a particular oracle, and each TM only computes countably many things.)

By **particular oracle**, it is meant of an oracle for a decision problem $X$ (e.g. RE or $\Sigma_3$).
