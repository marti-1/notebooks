# Formulas

* **F1** Each [propositional variable](https://github.com/marti-1/notebooks/blob/master/math/on-propositional-variables.md) is a formula.
* **F2** If A and B are formulas, so are $!A, (A \lor B), (A \land B), (A \rightarrow B), (A \iff B)$
* **F3** Every formula is obtained by a finite number of applications of F1 and F2.
